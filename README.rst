Data types for representing *System diagrams* in Python.

System diagrams may be for example:

* **block diagrams** (like for signal processing and control)
* **electrical circuits** (lumped RLC elements connected with wires)
* **mechanical systems** (represented with lumped masses, springs and dampings)
