TODO list
=========

(sept 2013)
Use traits to automate some checking operations.
In particular for system's parameters

(sept 2013) DONE
Use lists instead of dict to hold references to subsystems and ports.
Advantage: no duplication of the `name` information.

(sept 2013) DONE (but do not implement reparenting)
Manage parent relationship when connecting blocks. Check that they belong
to the same system. If one parent system is None, re-parent it. If parents are
different, raise an ???Error.

(sept 2013) DONE (systems now have a `wires` list attribute)
Implement parent relationship for wires
(wires should/(or not?) have the system which subsystems they connect as parent)

(sept 2013) DONE (basic version for signal blocks and wires)
Implement incidence list retrieval

(sept 2013) DONE
Make `connect_systems` function more generic rather than signal-specfic
-> ability to have it derived in the elec module

(oct 2013) DONE (json dump)
Implement serialization/saving of a diagram (which format ?)

(oct 2013) DONE (but yet to use classmethods instead of constructors)
Implement load/deserialization from json format
(mainly an issue of *reconstructing the connections*)

(oct 2013) DONE
Implement equality/similarity for comparing Systems, Wires and Ports
 * Systems have __eq__ ("real equality" test)
 * Ports and Wires have _is_similar
